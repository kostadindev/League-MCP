# League Model Context Protocol (MCP)

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for League of Legends exposing all Riot Games APIs, static resources (champions, items, tiers, etc.), and workflow prompts. Includes a client using a LangChain ReAct agent (Google Gemini) for tool/resource/prompt calls.

## Features
- Riot Games API coverage: Account, Summoner, Match, League, Spectator, Champion, Clash, Tournament, Status, Challenges
- Static resources: champions, items, summoner spells, queues, maps, game modes, ranked tiers
- Workflow prompts: player stats, champion analysis, team comps, tournaments, improvement plans
- Agentic client: LangChain ReAct agent (Google Gemini) with Gradio UI

## Quickstart

1. Clone and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   git clone <this-repo-url>
   cd League-MCP
   # (install requirements in mcp-server and mcp-client as needed)
   ```

2. Set environment variables in `.env` files:
   - In `mcp-server/.env`:
     ```env
     RIOT_API_KEY=your_riot_api_key
     ```
   - In `mcp-client/.env`:
     ```env
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
     ```

3. Run the MCP server:
   ```bash
   cd mcp-server
   python main.py
   ```

4. Run the MCP client (from the project root):
   ```bash
   python mcp-client/client.py mcp-server/main.py
   ```

- The client launches a Gradio web UI. Example queries:
  - What is the current rank of Sneaky#NA69?
  - Show me ddragon://champions
  - Use find_player_stats for Faker#T1
