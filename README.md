## Quickstart

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <this-repo-url>
   cd League-MCP
   ```

2. Install dependencies (choose one method):

   **Option A: Using pip**
   - In `mcp-server/`:
     ```bash
     cd mcp-server
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     cd ..
     ```
   - In `mcp-client/`:
     ```bash
     cd mcp-client
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     cd ..
     ```

   **Option B: Using uv (recommended for faster installs)**
   - First install uv if you haven't already:
     ```bash
     pip install uv
     ```
   - In `mcp-server/`:
     ```bash
     cd mcp-server
     uv sync
     cd ..
     ```
   - In `mcp-client/`:
     ```bash
     cd mcp-client
     uv pip install -r requirements.txt
     cd ..
     ```

3. Set environment variables in `.env` files:
   - In `mcp-server/.env`:
     ```env
     RIOT_API_KEY=your_riot_api_key
     ```
   - In `mcp-client/.env` (only if you want to try out the client):
     ```env
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
     ```

4. Run the MCP server independently:

   **Using pip/python:**
   ```bash
   cd mcp-server
   python main.py
   ```

   **Using uv:**
   ```bash
   cd mcp-server
   uv run main.py
   ```

4.5. Run the MCP client and the MCP server together (from the project root):

   **Using pip/python:**
   ```bash
   python mcp-client/client.py mcp-server/main.py
   ```

   **Using uv:**
   ```bash
   uv run mcp-client/client.py mcp-server/main.py
   ```

- The client launches a Gradio web UI. Example queries:
  - What is the current rank of Sneaky#NA69?
  - Show me ddragon://champions
