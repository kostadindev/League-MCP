## Quickstart

1. Clone and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   git clone <this-repo-url>
   cd League-MCP
   # (pip install -r requirements in mcp-server and mcp-client as needed)
   ```

2. Set environment variables in `.env` files:
   - In `mcp-server/.env`:
     ```env
     RIOT_API_KEY=your_riot_api_key
     ```
   - In `mcp-client/.env`:
     ```env
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
     ```

3. Run the MCP server:
   ```bash
   cd mcp-server
   python main.py
   ```

4. Run the MCP client (from the project root):
   ```bash
   python mcp-client/client.py mcp-server/main.py
